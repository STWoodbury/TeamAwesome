## Hurricane Season - A Historical Impact Analysis

# Proposal:
Weather and Climate disasters are among the most costly events for those within their path. With projected annual costs at $165 billion and major climate events averaging 20 per year in the United States[(2002, NOAA Office for Coastal Management)](https://coast.noaa.gov/states/fast-facts/hurricane-costs.html), an understanding of the range and impact of these disasters is of paramount importance. 

This study focuses on historical statistics and impacts of Hurricaine Season in order to gain a greater understanding of their significance over time. The below sections are desined to answer the following research questions:

<ol>
  <li>What are the historical trends of the frequency, severity, and types of storms?</li>
  <li>Is there a correlation of the frequency, severity, and type of storm to average ocean temperatures?</li>
  <li>What is the human impact of these storms across time as characterized by landfall percentage and financial cost?</li>
  <li>What predictions, if any, can be made from examining the aforementioned historical trends? </li>
</ol>

# Section 1: Historical Trends

This section aims to examine the historical trends of storms as a prerequisite to the following analyses. The study will analyze x years of data to examine the number of storms, the severity of those storms, and the storms' categorization to establish change over time. 

<b>Primary Questions</b>
 <ol>
    <li>Has the frequency of storms per season changed over time?</li>
    <li>Has the intensity/severity of storms changed over time?</li>
</ol>

<b>Possible Visualizations:</b> 
<ul>
    <li>line graph of storms per season</li>
    <li>stacked bar chart of category ratings as percentage</li>
</ul>

    <li>[National Hurricaine Center](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/)</li>
</ul>

# Section 2: Water Temperature Correlation

This section aims to examine correlation between average oceanic water temperature and storm frequency and intensity/severity:

<b>Primary Questions</b>
 <ol>
    <li>Does the average oceanic water temperature correlate to storm frequency?</li>
    <li>Does the average oceanic water temperature correlate to storm severity?</li>
    <li>If correlations exist, what is the significance of these correlations?</li>
</ol>

Possible Visualizations: 
<ul>
    <li>scatter plot of average ocean temperature vs storm frequency with regression</li>
    <li>scatter plot of average ocean temperature vs storm category with regression</li>
</ul>

</ul>

# Section 3: Human Impact Analysis

This section aims to examine the relationship of historical storm trends to overall human impact:

<b>Primary Questions</b>
 <ol>
    <li>Is there a difference over time in the ratio of landfall vs. non-landfall storms?</li>
    <li>Is there a difference over time in the per-capita financial impact of storms?</li>
</ol>

Possible Visualizations: 
<ul>
    <li>scatter plot of average ocean temperature vs storm frequency</li>
    <li>scatter plot of average ocean temperature vs storm category</li>
</ul>

# Section 4: Future Storm Projection

Given the examinations above, this section attempts to make future projections based on historical trends 

<b>Primary Questions</b>
 <ol>
    <li>What do these trends tell us about the future of oceanic temperature?</li>
    <li>What do these trends tell us about the future of storm frequency?</li>
    <li>What do these trends tell us about the future of storm intensity/severity?</li>
    <li>What do these trends tell us about the future of human impact from storms?</li>
</ol>

Possible Visualizations: 
<ul>
    <li>line graph of projected future oceanic temperatures</li>
    <li>scatter plot of projected future oceanic temperatures vs. number of storms</li>
    <li>stacked bar plot of projected ratios of storm intensity/severity</li>
    <li>line graph of projected financial impact of storms</li>
</ul>
